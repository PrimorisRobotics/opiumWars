								<h2>Britain's point of view</h2>
								<p>Britain used to trade with China in the 1800s. They wanted Chinese goods, but were too broke to pay for them. They decided to grow opium in their Indian territories and trade that with China. China really didn't like this to the point where a high Chinese official sent a letter to Queen Victoria.</p>

								<h2>China's point of view</h2>
								<p>China and Britain used to trade in the 1800s. China was supplying Britain with useful materials such as silk, porcelain, and <b>especially</b> tea, while Britain was giving back things that China never really needed. so when China refused trade from Britain because China did not need the things Britain gave them in return, Britain instead started to ship in a drug called<i> opium</i>, and China immediately went into a state of being addicted to opium, enraging the council of China, especially because China has a law against importing Opium. China could not fight back though, because opium got into the ranks of the military, rendering them unable to fight back. Just as things were looking grim for China, in spring of 1839 China confiscated and burned <i>1,400 tons</i> of Opium, marking a major point in the Opium wars for China. In the November of the same year, the first major battle of the wars took place, the Battle of The Pearl River. In the battle, the British destroyed a Chinese blockade near Hong Kong. In June of 1840, the British captured a trading port and blocked all of the others. In January of 1941, an initial agreement to end the crisis is reached by Chinese and British representatives, but the agreement will not be accepted by either countryâ€™s government.</p>
