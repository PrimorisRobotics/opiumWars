								<h2>Short Summmary (TL;DR)</h2>
								<p>British traded with China, but the deal was mostly one-sided: British got things they need (tea, silk, china), when China got things they didn't care about. China got more strict with trading, and soon they stopped trading with the British in general. Britain then sold opium so they could still get money from China. This tore apart China, because of how addictive and harmful Opium was, and when China burned 25,000 pounds worth of opium, Britain responded by taking some of China's Major cities. Afterwards, the Treaty of Nanjing came, and Britain got Hong Kong for 99 years.</p>

								<h2>Full Overview</h2>
								<p>China and Britain used to trade in the 1800s. China was supplying Britain with useful materials such as silk, porcelain, and <b>especially</b> tea, while Britain was giving back things that China never really needed.<br>
								So when China refused trade from Britain because China did not need the things Britain gave them in return, Britain instead started to ship in a drug called<i> opium</i>, and China immediately went into a state of being addicted to opium, enraging the council of China, especially because China has a law against importing Opium. China could not fight back though, because opium got into the ranks of the military, rendering them unable to fight back. Just as things were looking grim for China, in spring of 1839 China confiscated and burned <i>1,400 tons</i> of Opium, marking a major point in the Opium wars for China.<br>
								In the November of the same year, the first major battle of the wars took place, the Battle of The Pearl River. In the battle, the British destroyed a Chinese blockade near Hong Kong. In June of 1840, the British captured a trading port and blocked all of the others. In January of 1941, an initial agreement to end the crisis is reached by Chinese and British representatives, but the agreement will not be accepted by either countryâ€™s government. Fast forward to august of 1942, where after months of negotiation, the Brits took over Guangzhou, modern day Canton and used it as a front for the rest of the battles around that area. To bring the Opium wars to a close, both sides signed the treaty of Nanjing. The treaty changes the amount of chinese trading ports from one to five and it gives Britan the territory of Hong Kong in exchange for peace between the two nations.</p>
