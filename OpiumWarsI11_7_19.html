							<h2>China's point of view</h2>
							<p>China and Britan used to trade in the 1800s. China was supplying Britan with useful materials such as silk, porcelain, and <b>especially</b> tea, while Britan was giving back things that China never really needed. so when China refused trade from Britan because China did not need the thing Britan gave them in return, britan instead started to ship in a drug called<i> opium</i>, and China immediately went into a state of being addicted to opium, enraging the council of China, especially because China has a law against importing Opium. China could not fight back though, because opium got into the ranks of the military, redering them unable to fight back.</p>
