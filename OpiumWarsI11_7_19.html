							<h2>Britain's point of view</h2>
							<p>Britain used to trade with China in the 1800s. They wanted Chinese goods, but were too broke to pay for them. They decided to grow opium in their Indian territories and trade that with China. China really didn't like this to the point where a high Chinese official sent a letter to Queen Victoria.

							<h2>China's point of view</h2>
							<p>China and Britain used to trade in the 1800s. China was supplying Britain with useful materials such as silk, porcelain, and <b>especially</b> tea, while Britain was giving back things that China never really needed. So when China refused trade from Britain because China did not need the thing Britain gave them in return, Britain instead started to ship in a drug called<i> opium</i>, and China immediately went into a state of being addicted to opium, enraging the council of China, especially because China has a law against importing Opium.</p>
