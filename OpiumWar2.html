						<h2>Full Overview</h2>
						<p>Before the First Opium War, China had very tight restrictions on trading because China had little products they wanted and they didn't have. Britain wanted Chinese goods. After the Chinese lost, they were forced to loosen trading restrictions. Britain still thought of this as too tight, so they fought again in the Second Opium War. And China suffered another defeat, now forced to allow foreigners into Chinese mainland, including the Chinese capital. This happened by Britain forcing China to sign unfair treaties that benefited Britain more than China</p>
