						<h2>Full Overview</h2>
						<p>The Second Opium War didn't officially start until October of 1856, but Febuary of the same year a French missionary was killed in Guangxi, China, so it all was very tense. The thing that officially started the Second Opium War was Chinese officials boarding a British-registered ship and allegedly lowering the British flag. At that time, Britan was looking for an excuse to start another war to get even more trading rights with the Chinese. In response to that ship incedent, Britan sent a battleship to Canton, and the war begins. France decides to use the missionary killed earlier as an excuse to join Britan in the war, hoping to get some French trading rights in China as well. Later in December of 1856, the Chinese decide to attempt to make a power move and burn some foriegn factories in Canton. Nothing happens for about a year until December of the following year, where France and Britan decide to combine forces and overwhelm Canton, quickly capturing it. In May of 1858, Russia and China make a deal so that only those two nations can cross the Amur, Ussuri, and Sungari rivers. On May 20, 1858 the British and French capture the Dagu forts on the Hai River. From June to November of 1858 the hostilities between the three countries end, where the French and British get what they wanted and a little more, where <i>Opium</i> (remember that from the first opium war, folks?) is leagalized in China. Even though a treaty was signed and the hostilities were supposed to end, a British ship sailed through the Dagu river, even though they were refused passage, and the hostilities resume. However, the British ship was carrying diplomats from Britan and France, so it was not a warship. They suffered heavy casualties and were driven back. After a long push in August of 1860, the Dagu forts were destroyed and the transport continued. After a month of smooth sailing, the ship reaches Beijing and the troops burned the emperor's summer palace. Finally in November, China, Britan, and France sign the <i> Beijing Convention</i>, officially ending the Opium Wars, to this day. That sheet of paper gives Britan and France the territory of the <i> Kowloon Peninsula</i> (yes, I spelled that correctly.)</p>
