						<h2>Britain's Point of view</h2>
						<p>Britain was victorious in the First Opium War, forcing China to open trading restrictions. However they weren't fully satisfied. They wanted to have access to the Chinese mainland. And after they won the Second Opium War, they got just that.</p>

					<div class="column">
						<h2>China's point of view</h2>
						<p>Before the First Opium War, China had very tight restrictions on trading because China had little products they wanted and they didn't have. Britain wanted Chinese goods so they didn't like it, then they fought. After they lost, they were forced to loosen trading restrictions. Britain still thought of this as too tight, so they fought again in the Second Opium War. And China suffered another defeat, now forced to allow foreigners into Chinese mainland, including the Chinese capital.</p>
